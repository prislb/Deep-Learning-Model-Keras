# Simple-Deep-Learning-Model-Keras
This case study consists of building a regression model using the Keras library to model data about concrete's compressive strength. The goal is to experiment with building a neural network by increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers and to observe how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.   ### The data we are using contains information on the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different ingredients that were used to make them.
