<h1 align="center"> Create a simple Deep Learning Model with Keras </h1>

This case study is part of IBM's *Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras* Course. It consists of building a regression model using the Keras library to model data about concrete's compressive strength. The goal is to experiment with building a neural network by increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers and thus observe how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.
